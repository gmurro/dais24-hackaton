# DressMe - Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an automated system that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract product IDs from input text requests.
Given a text input, DressMe will propose three components of your outfit (top, bottom and shoes).

DressMe will recommend your entire outfit for your event!

# Key Features and Components

### Input Text Processing:

Users will provide text inputs, which could be in the form of customer service queries, emails, chat messages, or other unstructured text formats.
Example input: "I don't know what to wear next week for my new job. I'm a male an I like to wear casual clothes. Can you provide me an appelling outfit to buy?"

### LLM Integration:

Integration of Meta Llama Model to analyze the input text and identify patterns that correspond to product IDs.
Use the model's capabilities to understand context and extract relevant numerical sequences tagged as product IDs.
